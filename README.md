# Epidemiological Models of Venereal Diseases
This project is dedicated to mathematical epidemiological models that describe and analyze the spread of infectious diseases, particularly venereal diseases. The project uses a deterministic approach, which is widely used in mathematical biology.
## Project Goals
- Introduction and analysis of the SIR model: One of the simplest epidemiological models describing the basic development of an epidemic.
- Numerical solution of the SIR model: Implementation and numerical solution of the model.
- SEIR model: An extension of the SIR model with an additional category of "Exposed" (E).
- Specifics of venereal diseases: Discussion of the specifics and dynamics of the spread of venereal diseases.
- Basic model of venereal diseases: A simple mathematical representation describing venereal diseases.
- Advanced model of HIV/AIDS: A more complex model describing the dynamics of HIV/AIDS spread.
- Analysis and numerical solution of the HIV/AIDS model: Detailed analysis and numerical solution of the model.
